## Cross-Phase Integration

### Defects

**1. package.json `"main"` field points to nonexistent file**
- `"main": "dist/index.js"` — file does not exist (no `src/index.ts`)
- Should be `"main": "dist/cli.js"`
- Impact: CLI install path (`bin` field) works correctly; programmatic `require('claude-auto-continue')` throws MODULE_NOT_FOUND
- Affects: PUBL-01 (pre-publish verification should catch this)
- Recommended fix: Change `"main"` to `"dist/cli.js"` before publishing

### Verified E2E Flows

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| CLI invocation → ProcessSupervisor → PTY spawn → detection → wait → resume | COMPLETE |
| bin wrapper → dist/cli.js → main() | COMPLETE |
| package.json bin/files → npm pack includes correct content | COMPLETE (with main field caveat) |
| README install command → package name match | COMPLETE |

### Wiring Summary

- **12 exports** properly connected across phases
- **1 orphaned export** (`hideCursor` in ansi.ts — unused dead code)
- **1 broken entry point** (`main` field in package.json)
- **All 91 tests pass**, TypeScript compiles cleanly

---

## Tech Debt

### Phase 3: Single-Session Status Display
- `hideCursor` export in `src/ansi.ts` is dead code — exported but never imported

### Phase 2: Single-Session PTY Wrapper
- `MaxListenersExceededWarning` in test suite from repeated `process.stdout.on('resize')` without cleanup (non-issue in production)

**Total: 2 items across 2 phases**

---

## Summary

Phase 5 (Package Preparation) is fully verified with all 8 requirements satisfied. However, phases 6-8 remain unstarted, leaving 5 requirements unsatisfied. Two of these phases (6: GitHub Hosting, 8: Publish) require user action. One integration defect (package.json `main` field) should be fixed before publishing.
