<objective>
Create README.md at the project root with a description, shields.io badges, install instructions, usage examples, Linux build-tool prerequisites, how-it-works section, and license.

Purpose: README.md is the primary content on the npm registry page. It is the first thing potential users see. A clear, professional README directly drives adoption. npm automatically includes README.md in every published tarball — no `files` array change needed.

Output: README.md at project root
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create README.md with all required sections</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create `README.md` at the project root (`/Users/dakmor/Projects/Other/claude-auto-continue/README.md`) with the following sections in this exact order:

**1. Title and tagline:**
```markdown
# claude-auto-continue
```
One-line description: "Automatically resumes Claude Code sessions after usage limits reset — no manual babysitting."

**2. Badges (three shields.io badges):**
```markdown
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/claude-auto-continue.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/claude-auto-continue)
[![Node.js >=18](https://img.shields.io/node/v/claude-auto-continue.svg)](https://nodejs.org)
[![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
```
Note: npm badges resolve correctly once the package is published. They are safe to include now.

**3. Description paragraph:**
Explain what the tool does: wraps Claude Code in a PTY, monitors for rate-limit messages, waits with a countdown timer and status bar, then sends "continue" automatically at reset time. Emphasize the core value: leave Claude Code running unattended and it will resume by itself.

**4. Install section (`## Install`):**
```bash
npm install -g claude-auto-continue
```

**5. Usage section (`## Usage`):**
Show three examples:
```bash
claude-auto-continue          # start — launches 'claude' automatically
clac                          # short alias
clac -- --continue            # pass flags through to Claude Code
```
Briefly explain that all arguments after `--` are forwarded to `claude`.

**6. Prerequisites section (`## Prerequisites`):**
Explain that `node-pty` is a native addon requiring build tools at install time.

For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3 make g++
```

For macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (usually pre-installed). Mention `xcode-select --install` if not.

For Windows: Note that windows-build-tools may be needed.

State clearly: "Node.js >= 18 is required."

**7. How It Works section (`## How It Works`):**
Numbered list:
1. Wraps `claude` in a pseudo-terminal (PTY) so it receives a real TTY
2. Monitors all output with a regex-based pattern detector for rate-limit messages
3. Parses the reset timestamp from the rate-limit message
4. Displays a status bar and centered countdown card while waiting
5. Sends `continue` to the PTY at reset time, automatically resuming the session
6. Returns to monitoring — handles multiple rate limits in a single session

**8. License section (`## License`):**
Just the word `ISC`.

Keep the README concise and scannable. No emoji. Use fenced code blocks for all commands. Target approximately 60-80 lines of markdown.

  <name>Task 2: Verify README inclusion in npm tarball</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Run `npm pack --dry-run` and verify that `README.md` appears in the tarball file listing. This confirms npm will include the README on the registry page when published.

Expected: The output should contain a line like `README.md` among the packed files. If it does NOT appear, check that the file is named exactly `README.md` (case-sensitive) and is at the project root (same directory as package.json).

Do not modify the `files` array in package.json — npm includes README.md automatically regardless of the `files` whitelist.

Run all checks to confirm README is complete and packaged:

```bash
# 1. File exists and has content
wc -l README.md

# 2. All required sections present
grep -c "## Install\|## Usage\|## Prerequisites\|## How It Works\|## License" README.md
# Expected: 5

# 3. Badges present
grep -c "shields.io" README.md
# Expected: 3

# 4. Tarball includes it
npm pack --dry-run 2>&1 | grep "README.md"
```

<success_criteria>
- `README.md` exists at project root with 60+ lines
- Contains description, three shields.io badges, install command, usage with `clac` alias, Linux prerequisites with `build-essential`, how-it-works numbered list, and ISC license
- `npm pack --dry-run` shows README.md in the tarball listing
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-package-preparation/05-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
